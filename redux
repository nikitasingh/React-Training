Redux == data
React == view

React - 3 principles
1) one immutable object
Store is an object that stores entire states of the application

2)Actions trigger changes, like click,

3) Reducers update state

Every action has type property which tells what type of action, rest of the dataa can be anything/

Reducers takes "store" object and return a new state.

when store gets updated, Reac-Redux communicate it back to react view
